    <h2 class="mt-10">What is a cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto (short for cryptocurrency) is a new form of digital money powered by
      cryptography.<br />
      It all started in 2008 with Bitcoin. You could use it to send funds to anyone
      anywhere globally. What made crypto different from normal bank transfers or other
      financial .<br />
      services like Paypal or Alipay is that there was no middle man for the first
      time.<br />
      Wait, what is a middle man? <br />
      A middle-man is a central authority like a bank or government that intervenes in a
      transaction between the sender and recipient. They have the power to surveill,
      <br />
      censor or revert transactions and they can share the sensitive data they collect
      about you with third parties. They also often dictate which financial services you
      have <br />
      access to.<br />
      Things are different with crypto. Transactions directly connect sender and recipient
      without having to deal with any central authority. Nobody else will have access to
      <br />
      your funds and nobody can tell you what services you can use. This is possible
      because of the blockchain technology upon which cryptocurrencies operate.<br />

    <h2 class="mt-10">What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin?</h2>
    <p>
      Launched in 2015, Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big
      differences.<br />
      Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is
      programmable, so you can also build and deploy decentralized applications on its<br />

      network.<br />
      Ethereum being programmable means that you can build apps that use the blockchain to
      store data or control what your app can do. This results in a general purpose <br />
      blockchain that can be programmed to do anything. As there is no limit to what
      Ethereum can do, it allows for great innovation to happen on the Ethereum
      network.<br />
      While Bitcoin is only a payment network, Ethereum is more like a marketplace of
      financial services, games, social networks and other apps that respect your privacy
      and <br />
      cannot censor you.<br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-10">Who runs Ethereum?</h2>
    <p>
      Ethereum is not controlled by any one entity. It exists solely through the
      decentralized participation and cooperation of the community. Ethereum makes use of
      nodes<br />
      through the decentralized participation and cooperation of the community. Ethereum
      makes use of nodes nd cloud systems owned by major internet providers and<br />
      services.<br />
      These distributed nodes, run by individuals and businesses all over the world,
      provide resiliency to the Ethereum network infrastructure. It is therefore much
      less<br />
      vulnerable to hacks or shutdowns. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has never
      suffered downtime. There are thousands of individual nodes running Ethereum <br />
      This makes Ethereum one of the most decentralized cryptocurrencies out there, second
      only to bitcoin.<br />
